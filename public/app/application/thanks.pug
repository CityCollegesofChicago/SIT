            <strong>WHAT DO I NEED TO KEEP IN MIND?</strong>
            p
                | The City Colleges of Chicago Foundation is committed to awarding as many scholarships as possible to financially support studentsâ€™ education.
                | However, the Foundation does have its restrictions, therefore:
                ul
                    li.mb-1 <strong>Submission of a scholarship application does not guarantee a scholarship award or payment.</strong>
                    li.mb-1 The Foundation is bound to the wishes and directives of its donors.
                    li.mb-1 There are several kinds of City Colleges of Chicago Foundation scholarship awards:
                        ul
                            li Last-dollar, which means funds are paid after all other financial aid resources (Pell/MAP/Outside scholarships, etc.) have been awarded.
                            li Non-refundable scholarships, which means that any funds that remain after tuition, books and any other donor-defined funding has been paid, cannot be paid to the student. These funds stay within the Foundation.
                            li Refundable scholarships which means that funds that remain from the award after tuition, books and any other donor-defined funding has been paid, may be disbursed to the student.
                    li.font-weight-bold.mb-1 Students are subject to City Colleges of Chicago payment deadline policies regardless of the submission of the scholarship application.
            <strong>WHAT DO YOU EXPECT FROM ME?</strong>
            ul
                li.mb-1 WRITE A THANK YOU NOTE: This lets the donor know you appreciate their support. Someone will contact you with details on where to send a note.
                li.mb-1 BE WILLING TO MEET THE DONOR: In the future, we will create opportunities for some of our scholarship recipients to meet the donor of their scholarship. This will be a wonderful opportunity to connect and network with the person or company who is funding your education.
                li.mb-1 WRITE A NOTE WITH AN UPDATE TO THE DONOR: Your update could include academic and career plans, progress in your classes, challenges you are facing, and anything else you want the donor to know about you and your dreams for the future.
